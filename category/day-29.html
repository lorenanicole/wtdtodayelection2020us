<p><em>Published last at 11:20pm CDT October 5 2020, subject to change throughout the day.</em></p>
<p>Polling from various groups shows that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/">Biden's lead</a> post the first Presidential Debate has increased including the <a href="https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NorthCarolinaResultsOctober2020.pdf">Public Policy Polling</a> group:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve done about 70 private polls this week and a very noticeable trend we&#39;re seeing especially the last few days is that where before Biden was maybe getting 6-8% of 2016 Trump voters, that&#39;s pretty consistently starting to be more like 10-12%</p>&mdash; PublicPolicyPolling (@ppppolls) <a href="https://twitter.com/ppppolls/status/1312803416935194624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, reports from Trump over the weekend seem to indicate Trump is largely unbothered. Instead Trump "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-covid-19-walter-reed-wave/2020/10/04/12dbe38c-064f-11eb-a166-dc429b380d10_story.html">told advisers on Sunday that he was getting bored being in the hospital and was tiring of watching coverage of his hospitalization</a>," and instead opted for an impromptu joy ride to wave to supporters before returning back to Walter Reed hospital. Trump, while wearing a mask, was in an enclosed space with Secret Service and seemed to have no regard for the health of those protecting him.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sound on!!! This man yelling embodies all my fears and why this elections is so important. Please vote. <a href="https://t.co/kTbhKgJQOd">https://t.co/kTbhKgJQOd</a></p>&mdash; Jim Gaffigan (@JimGaffigan) <a href="https://twitter.com/JimGaffigan/status/1312895447263043584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
<p>The fallout continues as White House journalists are livid given the added news of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has tested postitive for COVID19. Reporters have had strong feedback pointing out, "<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/10/white-house-reporters-fume-over-reckless-covid-response">Reporters have families and have been doing the right thing, wearing masks. The White House staff are relentlessly reckless</a>." Additionally "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/white-house-residence-staff-virus/2020/10/05/a8399794-0645-11eb-9be6-cf25fb429f1a_story.html">the White House residence staff members are largely Black and Latino, and often elderly</a>" have been needlessly exposed too. </p>
<p>The continued bafoonery of the White House administration and Trump demonstrates plainly and. clearly: Trump and his people do not care about us. Nor will they do anything to contradict their own personal interest. The inaction to plan for COVID19, the failure to denounce White Supremacy, the fearmongering and attempt to thrawt public trust in mailin voting, the <a href="https://twitter.com/jtlarsen/status/1313088281207287813?s=20">dismantling of indigenous people's sovereignty</a>. <em>These abuses, these failure sis not by chance, but by design</em>.</p>
