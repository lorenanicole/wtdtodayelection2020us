> "Fight for the things that you care about, but do it in a way that will lead others to join you." - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

On September 18 2020 the world lost a relentless advocate for women's rights, a public servant who gave it her all until the end: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

Graduating top of her class from Columbia Law School from early in her career, Ginsburg faced barriers when trying to find employment and eventually obtaining employment at Rugers Law School, "[where her employers informed her that she would be paid less than her male colleagues because she had a husband who earned a good income](https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/in-memory-of-justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-1933-2020/?initms_aff=nat&initms_chan=eml&utm_medium=eml&initms=200918_rbg_obit_gradead_sail&utm_source=sail&utm_campaign=rbg&utm_content=200918_civilliberties_obit_gradead&ms_aff=nat&ms_chan=eml&ms=200918_rbg_obit_gradead_sail)".

Ginsburg went on to lead the Women’s Rights Project at the ACLU. Her legal strategy focused on demonstrating the reality of sex discrimination by finding cases where men were those descriminated against. By building a basis that sex discrimination is real, she was able to help open the door for cases investigating sex descrimination towards women.

As a Justice, Ginsburg was always vigiliant. When the Supreme Court became more conservative she stepped up to call out the inequities she observed. Famously stating of the 2013 [Shelby County v. Holder ruling](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf) that dismantled core parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, [Ginsberg said](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/supreme-court-ruling.html), this ruling was "like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet".

Her dedication to public service, to intentional leadership that empowers women and is just led to her nickname "[The Notorious RBG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biIRlcQqmOc)".
