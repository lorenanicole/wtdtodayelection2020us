## Day 19  

_Published last at 12:50pm CDT October 15 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[17,560,471 ballots](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far accounting for 12.7% of the total votes cast in the 2016 general election. 

Tuesday evening #TrekTheVote held a panel with 19 Trek castmembers to tackle such topics as climate change, women empowerment, and social justice and equity as a Biden Harris fundraiser. A Trekkie myself, it was refreshing to see a group of individuals tackle topics such as these *head on* and not shy from them. Most tellingly was the reminder from Jeri Ryan that we cannot ignore politics as it is everywhere around us, especially in Star Trek.

However my most powerful moment came from Star Trek Discovery's Sonequa Martin-Green on the importance of imagination and representation:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;It&#39;s important to not only see yourself, but to see yourself at your highest potential, to see a Black woman who is not only a genius, but an incomparable genius, that takes representation to next level,&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/SonequaMG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SonequaMG</a> on playing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrekDiscovery?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StarTrekDiscovery</a>&#39;s Michael Burnham <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrekTheVote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TrekTheVote</a> <a href="https://t.co/z1qVCvu3yp">pic.twitter.com/z1qVCvu3yp</a></p>&mdash; BOOOrena &quot;La BRUJA Tigresa‚Äù Mesa @ #BLM üñ§ (@loooorenanicole) <a href="https://twitter.com/loooorenanicole/status/1316165305446658048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Meawhile this week Amazon had Amazon Prime Day resulting in [local businesses pleading for us to shop local](https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/10/15/on-amazon-prime-day-struggling-local-businesses-beg-chicagoans-to-shop-local-instead/?mc_cid=d7c12c033e&mc_eid=daf712056e), as local businesses continue to be exposed to the economic downturn related to the pandemic. The COVID stimulus continues to be politicized as [Trump has since reversed the call](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-stimulus-bill-trump-congress-go-big-go-home/) to support a stimulus bill in efforts to save his own Presidential bid hopes. Still, though, we are waiting for an [answer to a stimulus](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/14/politics/nancy-pelosi-wolf-blitzer-stimulus/index.html) be it $1.8 trillion or not.

Today is also the [last day for self-response and field data collection for the 2020 Census](https://www.ncdemography.org/2020/10/14/making-sense-of-the-census-october-14-update/) as [SCOTUS ruled on October 13th](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/13/921428056/supreme-court-allows-trump-administration-to-end-census-early) that the last Trump administration can end Census counting. This has huge significance on minority and immigrant communities. Notably, Stephen Roe Lewis, governor of the Gila River Indian Communit, commented, "With no explanation or rationale, a majority simply decided that our people do not deserve to be counted, thus continuing a long history of leaving Indian peoples at the margins of the U.S. society at large and economy". Since [April this year](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/2020-census-ending-early.html), the US Census Bureau has noted that there was a huge threat of meeting the December 31 2020 deadline to report their findings to the White House. Trump's desire to remove undocumented immigrants is a secret to no one and this damning decision to end the Census early allows the potential for Trump to simply remove their presence all together. History is written by the victories, is it not? 

And that brings us to tonight, where we will have not one but two townhalls, a 90 minute townhall with Biden on ABC and a 60 minute townhall with Trump on NBC. After the Commission on Presidential Debates decided to make the second Presidential debate virtual, due to Trump's COVID status, Trump backed out and Biden agreed to a townhall, to ya know continue to show up for he job interview to try convince the US public why he is the best candidate for the job. Trump's decision for a townhall is not due to any feeling of goodwill, nor does anyone with common sense think it is. What can we say of NBC's choice to air a townhall during the *same time* as Biden's? Many are saying it's a [ratings battle](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/521144-cnns-lemon-msnbcs-maddow-rail-against-nbc-for-trump-town-hall-embarrassing). That benefits *no one*.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Having dueling town halls is bad for democracy-voters should be able to watch both and I don‚Äôt think many will. This will be good for Trump because people like to watch his unpredictability. This is a bad decision. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vote?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#vote</a></p>&mdash; Katie Couric (@katiecouric) <a href="https://twitter.com/katiecouric/status/1316411774334308352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

So here's my short list for you: 

1. If you haven't go to [My 2020 Census](https://my2020census.gov/) and fill it out, and tell others to as well! Answers will be taken until 23:59:59 Hawaii Standard Time tonight!
2. Don't watch the Trump debate and give it a ratings boost. Wait until the recap to get the information, should there be any factual information to be found.
3. And, VOTE. May this Demi Lovato - Commander in Chief - song inspire you and head over to [IWILLVOTE.com](https://iwillvote.com) to make your plan.
