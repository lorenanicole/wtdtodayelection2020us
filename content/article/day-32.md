Not sure what else to say, except let's focus on the immediate things that matter:

1. *Monday is National Voter Registration Day - VOTE VOTE VOTE!*
2. Wednesday October 7th the VP Presidential Debate is still scheduled as of this writing
3. Make your voting plan. Head over to `IWillVote.com` and pair up [BallotReady](http://ballotready.com) to be in the know of all things (e.g. retaining judges as we've seen JUSTICES HAVE INFLUENCE).

Lastly, no one is shocked by the fallout from Tuesday's Presidential debate, except ... [Mr. Wallace](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/business/media/chris-wallace-debate-moderator.html):

> "Mr. Wallace conceded that he had been slow to recognize that the president was not going to cease flouting the debate’s rules."
