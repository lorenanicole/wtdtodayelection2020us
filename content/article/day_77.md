## Day 77   

_Published last at 09:40am CDT August 18 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

Last night Michelle Obama made a very direct ask of us all. Create your voting plan.

Details [vary state to state](https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vote-state-by-state-guide-voting-by-mail-early-in-person-voting-election/) and states are scrambling to clarify what date a mail in ballot [can be accepted](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/13/889751095/signed-sealed-undelivered-thousands-of-mail-in-ballots-rejected-for-tardiness). 

So, how are you planning to vote? I asked some of you all to weigh in, and some of you did:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just confirmed my voting registration and mailing address. Also got text alerts setup so I know when my ballot is mailed to me and received. I plan to take my ballot to a local drop site üëçüèª</p>&mdash; RedBear (@gizm0_0) <a href="https://twitter.com/gizm0_0/status/1295560853593264128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Registered! Got the receipt and know all my voting location and mail-in ballot drop-offs. Everyone should check their registrations as well as know their voting locations.</p>&mdash; mrcartoonster üá∫üá∏üáµüá∑ (@mrcartoonster) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrcartoonster/status/1295559663493107712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

So today's theme is simple -- *create your voting plan*.

### Just for fun

- Did you not love Michelle Obama's `VOTE` necklace? I think the [entire internet did](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/politics/michelle-obama-necklace-vote/index.html). The original by `BYCHARI` runs a few hundred, however there are some inspired in the the same spirit of voting like this necklace that [donates $5 USD to the League of Women Voters NYC](https://www.uncommongoods.com/product/the-vote-necklace). Enjoy.
