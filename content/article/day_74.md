## Day 74   

_Published last at 3:00pm CDT August 21 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

Last night was the final night of the DNC Convention and there was *no* better way to start than with the adorable Cedric Jr, son of US Rep Cedric Richmond, posed in front of "I am a man" in a New Orleans art gallery, grinning ear to ear reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.

Hitting on the story of who Democratic Presidential nominee Vice President Joe Biden is, stories of loss, faith, and family were shared by many. However, there was plenty of comedia relief offered by TikTok star and comedian Sarah Cooper as well as by last night's host acctress and [comedian Julia Louis-Dreyfus](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/julia-louis-dreyfus-dnc-speech-trump-joe-biden-2020-election-veep-a9681146.html) who went on the record confirm she is "proud to b a nasty, nasty woman".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump is going to hate this. Thank you Sarah Cooper. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DemConvention?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DemConvention</a> <br><br> <a href="https://t.co/17qCbdRqSU">pic.twitter.com/17qCbdRqSU</a></p>&mdash; Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) <a href="https://twitter.com/keithboykin/status/1296624666832969729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, I&#39;m here for all the nasty women. I, myself, am one.

Biden's acceptance speech confirmed to many what they have been wondering, does Biden have enough energy to take on the Presidency? "The best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose," Biden retorted on how loss in his life has been a catalyst for much of his career. Moving beyond the moral appeal, Biden [included some policy components](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/20/politics/biden-dnc-speech-transcript/index.html) of how to increase life for working class peoples such as reverting the $1.3 trillion takecut for the wealthiest 1 percent to fund climate change policy, healthcare reform, and more. 

As a staunch progressive, I expect to see and need to hear more about how we will work to challenge institutional racism and other forms of opression. How we will protect the most vulnerable. How we will take climate change seriously. How we will ensure immigrants and refugees are welcome in the United States of America.

[Last night was a big step](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/opinion/joe-biden-speech.html). However, there's still a lot more work to do.
