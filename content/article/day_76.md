Last night's [virtual DNC Convention roll call](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/us/politics/dnc-roll-call.html) brought us images reminding us *who this country is*:

- indigenous strength, such as the Sioux Nation at Standing Rock, of South Dakota

If you missed the roll call, you can view it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ9s4x_Mybs).

Today begins with some continued speculation on what is happening with the questionable changes to USPS:

["What he did was take three big steps forward and took one baby step back, and that just doesn't do it for us," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commented on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's annoucement to suspend changes to USPS until after the election](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/18/nance-pelosi-postal-service-changes-397824). What are those changes? We are still waiting to hear. Will changes already implemented be rolled back (e.g. removal of sorting machines)? Again, that too is unknown.

While changes to USPS may be in a suspended state, the USPS is still facing a suspected $25 billion USD dollar shortage.

### Call to Action

- Get your [flu shot](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/health/flu-vaccine-important-coronavirus-wellness/index.html). The WHO, [Dr. Fauci](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/16/health/coronavirus-flu-vaccine-twindemic.html), and many other health experts urge us all to get one as we wait for a COVID19 vaccine. Target/CVS already have flu shots, Walgreens is slated to start September 1 2020.

### Just for fun

- All our tech for this campaign is powered by amazing technologists whom I am *deeply thankful for*. Today, I'd like to thank Mica, a #LatinxInTech Chicago DNC engineer who is a prominent lead behind `IWillVote.com`, "the #1 site for taking action in 2020" as Democrats CTO describes.  So, go register on `IWillVote.com` and send some ❤️ over to Mica:

- Seriously, this Maine B&B - [Annabessacook Farm](http://annabessacookfarm.blogspot.com/) -, owned by DNC Convention Delegate Craig Hickman and his husband, brings me such joy. Who wants to book a 2021 trip? 
- Also, AOC is amazing. Her endorsement of Sen Sanders was in fact in line with DNC Convention procedures:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you were confused, no worries!<br><br>Convention rules require roll call &amp; nominations for every candidate that passes the delegate threshold.<br><br>I was asked to 2nd the nom for Sen. Sanders for roll call.<br><br>I extend my deepest congratulations to <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoeBiden</a> - let’s go win in November. 🇺🇸 <a href="https://t.co/uI92P3UfLn">https://t.co/uI92P3UfLn</a></p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1295902565750771717?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

So let's celebrate that and remember AOC's amazing dance moves, which are only scandalous in that they are scandalously FUNNNNN:
