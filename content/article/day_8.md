## Day 8  

_Published last at 5:21pm CDT October 26 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[62,014,329 ballots](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far accounting for 45% of the total votes cast in the 2016 general election. 

With the election just over a week away, many of us are starting to ponder what comes *next*. With the approval of Amy Coney Barrett as the next Supreme Court Justice, there are several issues on the docket for her first week including: abortion and Trump's taxes. Additionally, "Barrett also refused to say whether it’s OK to intimidate voters at the polls, and whether a president has the right to postpone an election. She would not say whether citizens have the right to health insurance. She would not speak up for workers’ rights or gun violence prevention rights," as the [Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/10/26/opinion/with-amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-your-liberty-depends-what-state-you-choose-live/) reports. The states will have [stronger sway in this current SCOTUS makeup](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/26/politics/taxes-election-abortion-amy-coney-barrett/index.html) which has prompted Vice President Biden to say that he plans to form a specifcal commission to [suggest Supreme Court reforms](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/oct/22/joe-biden-plans-special-commission-to-suggest-supreme-court-reforms).

The foundations of this country were built in a time when only a select few - a few select *white* *landowning* *men* - could vote. When the guarantee of "freedom" was limited to a small privileged minority. Today Justices live significantly longer, our demographics have shifted greatly. Biden's suggestion is but one step of many that needs to be considered in looking at overhauling not [only SCOTUS](https://www.vox.com/21514454/supreme-court-amy-coney-barrett-packing-voting-rights) but [the USA government](https://www.sceneonradio.org/episode-45-transformation-seeing-white-part-14/). We see this too as many women - many women of color, many single parent households, [have had to leave the workforce in the USA](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/20/925944351/why-women-are-leaving-the-workforce) in order to balance work and home during the pandemic. The strides of the last 50 years can be undone when we fail to invest in equtiable family planning and childcare opportunities. Additionally when we do not invest in women finding employment in positions where those benefits are offered.

When you think about voting, I want you to think about:

- Access to healthcare
- Access to reproductive justice
- Dismantling White Supremacy
- Investing in communities of color and women

Or, better yet, investing in the community of tomorrow, not one of some yesteryear where only a few select enjoyed the "American Dream".

So we need to all:

- Plan to vote, go to `IWillVote.com`, and help those in your life to vote as well. 
- Squash misinformation about the Election by staying up to date with the [CISA Rumor Control website](https://www.cisa.gov/rumorcontrol)
