## Day 6  

_Published last at 9:45pm CDT October 28 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[75,580,179 ballots](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far accounting for 54.8% of the total votes cast in the 2016 general election. 

In positive news the Supreme Court ruled to allow absentee votes to be accepted for 3 days after November 3rd in Pennsylvania and 9 days after November 3rd in North Carolina. Unsurprisginly Republicans in both states were in opposition of this. [However the Supreme Court has left the door open to potentially revisit the Pennsylvania ruling after November 3rd](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/supreme-court-pennsylvania-north-carolina-absentee-ballots.html).

Over in the Trump camp, receipts for services incurred during Trump's president totaling $8.1 million - $2.5 million funded by the US government (cough: us, the taxpayers) - have been released by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ballrooms-candles-and-luxury-cottages-during-trumps-term-millions-of-government-and-gop-dollars-have-flowed-to-his-propertiesmar-a-lago-charged-the-government-3-apiece-for-glasses-of-water-for-trump-and-the-japanese-leader/2020/10/27/186f20a2-1469-11eb-bc10-40b25382f1be_story.html). With over 280 visits to Trump's hotels and clubs Trump has made his businesses the cornerstone of where he conducts business. Elaborate costs at Mar-a-Lago ranged  from $34,200 for the Secret Service's lodging for a 2019  2 week Christmas stay to a $7,700 dinner with $6,000 floral arrangaments when Xi Jinping of China visited in 2017 (oh and a $1,005.60 bar charge).

The lack of care to the US public can also be seen when after a Trump rally last night in Omaha, Nevada attendees were stranded for hours in the cold. Some walked the 3 miles back to their cars and [30 people eventually needed medical attention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/28/trump-omaha-supporters-stuck-cold/).

Trump does not care about you. He only cares about one thing -  himself (oh and his bottom line).
