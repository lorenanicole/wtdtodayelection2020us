## Day 54   

_Published last at 23:07 September 9 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

There was a delay, in the news. I was convinced I was in the parallel universe. But. Nope.

Let's get to it:

- Defaming those that have laid their lives down for the good ol' USA
- Another book, another law suite
- A vaccine never tested, is the way to go right?

Guess what all those have in common ....

You got it.
