## Day 21  

_Published last at 12:40pm CDT October 13 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[11,475,707 ballots](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far accounting for 8.3% of the total votes cast in the 2016 general election. 

Outside Election 2020, we continue onto day 2 of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings. [Day 1](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/politics-and-the-pandemic-permeate-day-1-of-amy-coney-barrett-hearings) revealed several things including the Republicans trying hard to call these hearing a Constitutional duty, even when four years earlier Republicans blocked Democrats from having an Obama nominee heard. Democrats, on the other hand, dug deep into discussing the health implications that Barrett would bring if appointed to the Supreme Court. Namely on the impact to the Affordable Care Act. Vice Presidential candidate [Senator Kamala Harris commented](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/12/takeaways-day-one-barrett-confirmation-hearing/), "Republicans finally realized that the Affordable Care Act is too popular to repeal in Congress, so now they are trying to bypass the will of the voters and have the Supreme Court do their dirty work." We shall see how Day 2 progresses but we are bound to continue to see an emphasis from Democrats to the public on the impacts this hearing has on the here and now directly as it realtes to healthcare. As a queer Latinx woman, I am paying close attention as Republicans continue to parade about their decision as Constitutionally sound even if it means removing healthcare options for the most vulnerable. Or, more directly, trampling on the reproductive health rights of people like me. 

And where does Joe Bidne stand on all this? Well, Joe Biden continues to suggest the direction he'd take with the Supreme Court, not answering directly on if he'd "pack the court" but indtead suggesting he's "[not a fan](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/13/923213582/biden-says-hes-not-a-fan-of-expanding-the-supreme-court)" of expanding the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, we are seeing disturbing developments across the country with illegal ballot boxes being installed in California by the Republican Party and technical glitches causing [voter registration to be made unavailable in states like Virginia](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginia-voter-registration-site-down-on-last-day-to-register-to-vote-officials-say/65-3e5b390b-3e47-4a22-a440-6afddf770f3a).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BREAKING</a>; An accidentally cut cable has caused the entire Virginia voter registration online system to go down on the last day to register to vote before election day. <br><br>Here&#39;s what we know so far ⬇️<a href="https://t.co/9Ho2f2NZia">https://t.co/9Ho2f2NZia</a></p>&mdash; WUSA9 (@wusa9) <a href="https://twitter.com/wusa9/status/1316022991671619588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Everyone, you know the drill, go vote. Prepare for anything and everything to happen. Plan now, so we are all prepared.
