## It's Election Day 2020 

_Published last at 5:15pm CDT November 2 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[99,657,079](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far accounting for 72.3% of the total votes cast in the 2016 general election. 

Today starts with the news that  all 5 votes in Dixville Notch, a small North Hampshire township near the US-Canada border have [cast their ballots all for Biden](https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/02/politics/dixville-notch-2020-results/index.html).

But, this is no guarantee of anything to come. Nearly most the versed, non-Trump pundits are telling us to prepare for an Election that'll likely take some time to render a result.

Everywhere, [poll watchers will be taking to the polls too](https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/02/michigan-poll-watchers-election-challengers-rules/6125955002/). Disturbingly Right-Wing pollwatcher "training" has emphasized [fearmongering and paranoia](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/true-the-vote-poll-observer-training.html), Slate reports that ALan Vera a Texas' Harris County GOP warns that laxatives have been secretly somehow slipped into coffee for pollwatchers. 

Everywhere polls are also attempting to correct for bias in 2016, with Monmouth reporting that in PA they've adjusted education weight and still find Biden leading 5 to 7 points.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This comparison of Monmouth&#39;s final PA polls shows how samples have been adjusted to avoid a 2016 surprise. 2016 weighting on left, 2020 on right.<br><br>Dems are down from +11 to +2. And education weighting is added to ensure 64% are non-college.<br><br>Biden leads anyway, by 5 to 7 points. <a href="https://t.co/AHzZhg0tlP">pic.twitter.com/AHzZhg0tlP</a></p>&mdash; Will Saletan (@saletan) <a href="https://twitter.com/saletan/status/1323309442998390787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Fear aside, what we have seen is nearly 100 million cast their ballot *before Election Day*. This is unprecedented turnout. 

So, do me a favor, I'll be election judging today. What I need you all to do is:

- Stay calm, take mental breaks or just don't watch if it is causing you distress
- Go vote though, you must vote. 
- Help those around you vote
- And if you want to, do some [last minute text / phone banking espeically in Texas](https://www.mobilize.us/texasdemocrats/event/356837/).
