## Day 69   

_Published last at 6:17pm CDT August 26 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

Where do we begin.

Last night a white teenager from Illinois took it upon themselves to drive to Kenosha, armed with an AR-15, to join those - that some outlets are calling it - that are "[prepared to defend buildings](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/08/25/armed-group-hoping-to-protect-buildings-confronts-protesters-on-third-night-of-clashes-in-kenosha)".

Said teenager proceeded to use their gun during the protests. Three are confirmed to have been shot, two of those fatally. Files have been charged.  

The NIMBY rheotric so proudly flaunted earlier this week at *that* convention is eeirely timed with this.

Let's not write this off as the lone act of a vigilante. We need to name what this act is, white supremacy.

[Chicago's WBEZ reported](https://www.wbez.org/stories/3-shot-2-killed-in-3rd-night-of-unrest-over-police-shooting-of-jacob-blake/fe8964b4-150f-44fb-9eca-e37506a21851):

> According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.

## White supremacy is domestic terrorism.

### Just for fun

I mentioned loving scifi and fantasy earlier. The official accompanying podcast for Lovecraft Country is ðŸ”¥.  Y'all should check it out. Why

1. The podcast hosts are *EPIC* - [Ashley C. Ford](https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle) and Lovecraft Country writer [Shannon Houston](https://twitter.com/shannonmhouston).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I got all my work done today, and I remembered Iâ€™m beautiful, so thatâ€™s a win.</p>&mdash; Ashley C. Ford (@iSmashFizzle) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle/status/1298694338063597569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

2. Learning about the writing room is fascinating.
3. Think horror isn't that interesting? Try again! "Horror is the last place for hope" as co-host Ashley C. Ford sums up. This podcast *will* challenge how you think of scifi, fantasy, and horror. It is a much needed critical exploration in how privilege, racism, and white supremacy inform but also can be confronted in the creative spaces of storytelling and entertainment.
