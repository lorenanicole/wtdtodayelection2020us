## Day 25  

_Published last at 3:50pm CDT October 9 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[8,283,929 ballots](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far. This accounts for 6% of the total votes counted in the 2016 general election.

This morning we heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as she shared an update on Federal government business as it relates to the 25th Amendment:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SpeakerPelosi</a> News Conference on 25th Amendment - LIVE on C-SPAN <a href="https://t.co/5d3kSZYci4">https://t.co/5d3kSZYci4</a> <a href="https://t.co/g08bjmn1b7">pic.twitter.com/g08bjmn1b7</a></p>&mdash; CSPAN (@cspan) <a href="https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1314571678668685313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Broadly, the House is seeking a bipartisan board of Representatives that would have access to the President's health information. As we have seen with Trump's intentional obscufation, [he is claiming to be COVID19 free while pushing for Regeneron - a pharmaceutrical company](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/health/trump-covid-regeneron.html) - he alleges has cured him. With only Trump's word to trust, the House is taking steps to attempt to be ready to act if the need to replace Trump arises. Even though this board is unlikely to gain support, it speaks to the desparate desire of Trump and his cronies to rewrite history.  Much like [McConnell who also is trying to rewrite history](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/08/politics/mcconnell-white-house-coronavirus/index.html) as he alleges he hasn't been to the White House in weeks due to the Trump's handling of COVID19.

Even more baffling, Trump continues insistence that Biden's refusal to debate him in person shows Biden is weak. Trump additionally has taken to claiming tha the Commission on Presidental Debates decision to make such a debate virtual is a ploy to "[protect Biden](https://www.npr.org/2020/10/08/921538492/second-presidential-debate-to-be-virtual-commission-says)". With a [townhall now scheduled with Biden](https://6abc.com/biden-town-hall-abc-news-trump-pulls-out-of-debate-backs/6870120/) instead, the refusal of Trump to show up for the continued job interview speaks volumes: "In many ways, nothing symbolizes the Trump presidency better than an empty chair. This is a man who has refused time and again to show up for the American people," as [Skylar Baker-Jordan of The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-debate-biden-coronavirus-fox-and-friends-town-hall-b888185.html) sums up.	

Everyone, do like Beatrice Lumpkin and go vote.
