## Day 26  

_Published last at 12:40pm CDT October 8 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[6,339,316 ballots](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far. 

Kamala Harris showed up, she answered the questions asked of her, allowed her opponent time to respond, all while delivering the best non-verbal responses that no one has seen in a VP Debate before.

And when Pence attempted to take her time?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I&#39;m speaking.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/KOu5MUkrCH">pic.twitter.com/KOu5MUkrCH</a></p>&mdash; Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) <a href="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1314017350669217792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Even when Pence - a White man with all the privilege that only those that are White men can pretend to be ignorant of - attempted to lecture Harris on systemic racism. Kamala kept her composure, never losing her cool. She answered with precision, intentionally and directly. When asked if Americans should take a COVID19 vaccine that the Trump administration approves, Harris answered, "If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it."

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmm. Notice a pattern from the <a href="https://twitter.com/nytopinion?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nytopinion</a> writers who think Kamala won vs. Pence? <a href="https://t.co/3476OjAX4j">pic.twitter.com/3476OjAX4j</a></p>&mdash; Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaivanShroff/status/1314209539068051462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Kamala Harris not only [won last night's debate](https://www.politicususa.com/2020/10/08/vp-debate-poll.html), she demonstrated the clear failure that is the Trump administration. The Trump administration knows it to, since as of the writing of this post Trump has withdrawn from participating in next week's Presidential debate. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s too bad Trump is afraid to debate next week. <a href="https://t.co/4juvdgPfE7">pic.twitter.com/4juvdgPfE7</a></p>&mdash; Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeteButtigieg/status/1314212949255319556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Update: Joe Biden is moving forward with Wednesday's appearance and is scheduled to for a [Town Hall](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/joe-biden-abc-news-town-hall-presidential-debates-1234797920/). At least *someone* is taking the job interview serious.  

Regardless, register to vote. Let's make this defeat an overwhelming one.
