## Day 70   

_Published last at 1:55pm CDT August 25 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

I'm a huge fantasy and sci-fi nerd. Reading the update on what's next for [The Dark Crystal](https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/dark-crystal-age-of-resistance-netflix-lisa-henson-whats-next), Lisa Henson observed,

> "We have the Darkness creeping in, & it feels like Darkness has arrived in the human world now. The carelessness for life, that sort of self-interest business of the Skeksis... the[y] are ruthless."

This struck me hard -- the Dark Crystal is a reflection of the here & now.

Let me explain. Last night I observed the metaphorical Skeksis at The Republican National "Convention". Yes, I know, "why" is likely a question you have. I wondered that too. (Also: if about 1/2 the lineup involves your family be them blood or by relationship is that *really* a strong sign of unity?)

Night one was precisely as bizarre as expected.

From people with no political know how to a "not in my backyard couple" [made famous by touting guns and making veiled racist threats](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/08/18/903478960/st-louis-couple-who-brandished-guns-at-black-protesters-to-speak-at-rnc), night one demonstrated nothing. Nothing except the convention is a spectacle and the current admin will lie, cheat, and do anything to promote *their* interests.

Meanwhile in Kenosha, Wisconsin after the shooting of Jacob Blake, *another unarmed Black man*, protestors took to the streets.  The National Guard was called in. Also, [Blake's family announced he is paralyzed from the waist down](https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/8/25/21400481/jacob-blake-kenosha-police-shooting-riots-evanston). 

*When will the senseless brutalization of POC, but particularly the Black community stop?*

If you're a white person go sign up for Kim Crayton's "Being an Antiracist at home" happening on Saturday (see events below üëáüèΩ).
