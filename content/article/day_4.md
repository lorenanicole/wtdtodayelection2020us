## Day 4  

_Published last at 11:33am CDT October 30 2020, subject to change throughout the day._

[84,541,764](https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html) have been cast for Election 2020 thus far accounting for 61.3% of the total votes cast in the 2016 general election. 

In Minnesota the 8th Circuit court [has ruled to reject all absentee ballots received after 8:00pm on Election Day](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/politics/minnesota-mail-in-ballots/index.html).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: 8th Circuit appeals court forces Minnesota to reject all absentee ballots received after 8 p.m. on Election Day.<br><br>That ruling throws out the state‚Äôs 7-day grace period.

Unphased by these efforts, though, many have been heeding the call with early voting and mail-in voting records continuing to be broken. 

In [Texas more than 9 million have already been cast, which is more than 2016 turnout](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/10/30/us/trump-biden-election#more-than-9-million-people-have-voted-early-in-texas-surpassing-the-states-total-2016-turnout). This impressive turnout has offiically flipped the state [to be considered a "Toss-up" by various forecasters](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/10/texas-is-a-toss-up-biden-tries-to-grab-it.html).

Additionally, in another tightly monitored state, Georgia, Senate challenger Jon Ossoff reported last night that incumbent David Perdue cancelled their last debate for this weekend. Perdue cites his commitments to aiding Trump for the cancellation whereas Ossoff cites their Wednesday debate. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‚Äôd like to report a murder. Jon Ossoff slays GOP opponent Perdue in Georgia US Senate debate. <a href="https://t.co/RL2CrTPSMJ">pic.twitter.com/RL2CrTPSMJ</a></p>&mdash; John Aravosis üá∫üá∏üá¨üá∑üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà (@aravosis) <a href="https://twitter.com/aravosis/status/1321645508591521795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

These [continued efforts of squashing support for mail-in options](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/politics/mail-in-ballots-supreme-court-pennsylvania-wisconsin-north-carolina/index.html) and the continued developments where see see states - once considered Republican safegrounds - gaining Democratic momentum shows us that *we can and do have the power*.

It's up to every single one of us to:

- *Vote today, vote early* and if you cannot *make a plan to arrive early on November 3rd to vote*
- Inspire those in your networks to vote
- Use tools like `IWillVote.com` and `BallotReady.com` to help 

And most importantly, *take care of yourself and one another*, it's going to be a wild next week, and COVID's third wave is just starting. 

Let's take a leaf out of AOC's book and "drink water and don't be racist".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Republicans are Very Mad (again) about my appearance. This time they‚Äôre mad that I look good in borrowed clothes (again).<br><br>Listen, if Republicans want pointers on looking your best, I‚Äôm happy to share.<br><br>Tip #1: Drink water and don‚Äôt be racist</p>&mdash; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) <a href="https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1321887547564449793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Just for fun

Grudge, my most favorite Aquarian Space Catte and Star Trek Discovery heart throb, has been "sharing" some [news and insights on Twitter](https://www.startrek.com/news/5-things-you-should-know-about-discoverys-grudge?amp). They are all brilliant, including the news that "when I wave my tail gracefully, I'm waving from my carriage as I pass".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AQUARIAN SPACE CATTE RULES:<br>Love me.
