## Day 78

This week is the 100th year anniversary of the 19th Amendment. Or, better yet, we should remember that this week is only the 100th year anniversary of the 19th Amendment.

Even more timely? Last night, being the sci-fi nerd I am, in watching [Lovecraft Country](https://www.wired.com/story/lovecraft-country-essay/) last night many pointed to how Lovecraft Country included several images such as the tribute to [Gordon Park‚Äôs 1956 photograph outside a department store in Mobile, Alabama](https://www.newsweek.com/lovecraft-country-gordon-parks-photos-1525235) demonstrating the only to recent segregated past of the United States.
