# What To Do Today USA Election 2020

# The US Presidential Election is Tuesday, November 3 2020.

To help keep you informed, this website will be updated daily to include information on election relevant -- meaning topical issues (e.g. prision abolition) as well as election specific -- news, events, and calls to action.

### Feedback is expected, wanted, and continuously appreciated.

*Why a digest?*

Why not? This project is greatly inspired by the awesome work of Matt Kisher's [WTF Just Happened Today](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/about/). Unlike Matt's work, this digest is diliberately progressive, left learning, and unapologetic in its position of it.

*Values of this project*

- Accountability - we all have a hand in this 
- Transparency - how this content is shared will be tied back to original sources
- Leave things better than how we arrived - yup, basically we all need to step up and do the work, no one gets a cookie because they tweeted a thing that one time
