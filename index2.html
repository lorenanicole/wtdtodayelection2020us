<p>Even when Pence - a White man with all the privilege that only those that are White men can pretend to be ignorant of - attempted to lecture Harris on systemic racism. Kamala kept her composure, never losing her cool. She answered with precision, intentionally and directly. When asked if Americans should take a COVID19 vaccine that the Trump administration approves, Harris answered, "If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it."</p>
