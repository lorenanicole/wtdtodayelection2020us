<p><em>Published last at 6:20pm CDT August 26 2020, subject to change throughout the day.</em></p>
<p>Where do we begin.</p>
<p>Last night a white teenager from Illinois took it upon themselves to drive to Kenosha, armed with an AR-15, to join those - that some outlets are calling it - that are "<a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/08/25/armed-group-hoping-to-protect-buildings-confronts-protesters-on-third-night-of-clashes-in-kenosha">prepared to defend buildings</a>".</p>
<p>Said teenager proceeded to use their gun during the protests. Three are confirmed to have been shot, two of those fatally. Files have been charged.  </p>
<p>The NIMBY rheotric so proudly flaunted earlier this week at <em>that</em> convention is eeirely timed with this.</p>
<p>Let's not write this off as the lone act of a vigilante. We need to name what this act is, white supremacy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>White supremacy is domestic terrorism.</h2>

<h3>Just for fun</h3>
<p>I mentioned loving scifi and fantasy earlier. The official accompanying podcast for Lovecraft Country is 🔥.  Y'all should check it out. Why? Here's a few reasons why 👇🏾</p>
<ul>
<li>The podcast hosts are <em>EPIC</em> - <a href="https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle">Ashley C. Ford</a> and Lovecraft Country writer <a href="https://twitter.com/shannonmhouston">Shannon Houston</a>.</li>
</ul>

Ford (@iSmashFizzle) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle/status/1298694338063597569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
<ul>
<li>Learning about the writing room is fascinating.</li>
<li>Think horror isn't that interesting? Try again! "Horror is the last place for hope" as co-host Ashley C. Ford sums up. This podcast <em>will</em> challenge how you think of scifi, fantasy, and horror. It is a much needed critical exploration in how privilege, racism, and white supremacy inform but also can be confronted in the creative spaces of storytelling and entertainment. </li>
