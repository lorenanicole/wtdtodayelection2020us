</p>
                <section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Day 1</h2>
<p><em>Published last at 5:15pm CDT November 2 2020, subject to change throughout the day.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://electproject.github.io/Early-Vote-2020G/index.html">97,665,370 </a> have been cast for Election 2020 thus far accounting for 70.9% of the total votes cast in the 2016 general election. </p>
<p>Many are forecast that the odds are highly in favor of Joe Biden including:
- <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">The Economist giving 19 in 20 odds</a> of winning the electoral college and most votes
- <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo">FiveThirtyEight forecasting 89 out of 100 odds</a></p>
<p>Yet some of those forecasters are also reminding you that, Trump <em>can still possibly win</em>, as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/im-here-to-remind-you-that-trump-can-still-win/">FiveThirtyEight reminds us</a>, "a huge part of why our model and others’ think Trump can still win is the Electoral College. Trump has only a 3 percent chance of winning the popular vote in our model."</p>
<p>Luckily, in the backdrop of this we are seeing some promising rulings that are pushing back at the unconstitutional, criminal attempt to steal votes. A Federal judge today threw out yet another attempt to invalidate some 127,000 votes collected at drive-through voting sites in Houston. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/02/930365888/federal-judge-dismisses-effort-to-throw-out-drive-through-votes-in-houston">Justice Hanen asked</a>, "Why am I just getting this case?" noting that the drive-through voting has been ongoing all summer.</p>
<p>So what can we expect tomorrow? Anyone paying attention to the rhetoric of both camps and how they are making their closing arguments knows that the Trump response is to try to demand a result tomorrow. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump and Biden make their closing arguments <a href="https://t.co/Qsai4MkjoO">pic.twitter.com/Qsai4MkjoO</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1323344483459735552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
<p>But that isn't how our election works. We won't have the result tomorrow. In fact, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/us/politics/trump-ballot-counting-election.html"><em>it is NORMAL to not have a result on Election Day</em></a>. It will take some time. We have 1.) a pandemic 2.) unprecedented number of early voter ballots cast. Also, Trump and his cronies won't let the results stand without some meddling, so we all must be prepared and stand vigilant.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be an Election Judge in Chicago, working 5am to 7pm CT for when polls are open to close and then however long it takes after to officially submit votes. </p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
<p>So while there are those of us working the polls, we need <em>every single one of you to turn out and vote and help others to if you can</em>. </p>
<p>If you weren't able to today and need to vote tomorrow, you are still able to register in the following states:</p>
