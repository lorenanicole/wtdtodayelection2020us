                <section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Day 30</h2>
<p><em>Published last at 3:20pm CDT October 4 2020, subject to change throughout the day.</em></p>
<p>The news surrounding Trump's COVID condition has ranged from Republicans claiming Trump has "<a href="https://twitter.com/RonnyJackson4TX/status/1311946898207641600?s=20">no co-morbidities</a>" (even though, at age 74 Trump is very much at heightened risk) to Dr. Sean Conley informing the world that Trump is receiving dexamethasone, which is a "<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/10/04/trump-receiving-dexamethasone-steroid-usually-given-patients-with-severe-covid19/">steroid usually given to patients with sever COVID19</a>".</p>
<p>The confusing and contradictory information surrounding Trump's health status continues to demonstrate the overall lack of coherency that has come to mark this administration and campaign. As of the writing of this post, NYT lists <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/02/us/politics/trump-contact-tracing-covid.html">10 individuals </a> who had contact with Trump before his positive status have contracted COVID10:</p>
<p><img src="theme/images/day-30-tracing.png"> </p>
<p>Others like <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/02/mitch-mcconnell-wont-say-received-recent-covid-test/3592828001/">Mitch McConnell follow suite who, on Friday, refused to confirm if <em>he's been tested</em></a>. Ron Johnson too showed balatant disregard by attenting an Oktoberfest Party while <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-sen-ron-johnson-went-to-oktoberfest-party-after-testing-positive-for-covid-19">awaiting his results</a>. The future of the Trump campaign as well as the overall Republican strategy is bound to continue to amp up their campaign of misdirection. </p>

<p>In other news, though, after Trump's intentional sidestepping of condeming White Supremacy and White Supremacist groups like Proud Boys at last week's Presidential Debate, the queer community this past weekend has reclaimed the Twitter #ProudBoys to showcase the beauty of LGBTQI couples embracing in various moments of love and unity. Now <em>this is pride</em>! 🌈👬🏿🌈👬🏽🌈👬🏼!</p>
