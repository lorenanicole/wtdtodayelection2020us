            "text":"Day 75 Published last at 10:15am CDT August 20 2020, subject to change throughout the day. President Barack Obama, speaking at last night&#39;s Democratic Convention from Pennsylvania, delivered an emotionally charged and somber address. His message was simple, do not give up. Stay engaged. Plan: &#34;That is how *THEY* have influence over your life, when *THEY* convince [you that do not matter]; DO NOT LET THEM TAKE AWAY YOUR POWER, YOUR DEMOCRACY.&#34; - @BarackObama This. Is all you need to remember. Stay with me. Let&#39;s do it. #DemConvention #DemConvention2020— Loooorena &#34;La Tigresa&#34; Mesa @ #BlackLivesMatter 🖤 (@loooorenanicole) August 20, 2020 Furthermore, last night&#39;s Democratic Convention addresses focused on the role of women in politics. Notably Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pointing out, &#34;as America marks the centennial of women, finally, women winning the right to vote, we do so with 105 women in the House. Proudly, 90 are Democrats.&#34; KEEP RISING! (Notice @aoc is in the center. 👀😍). #DemConvention #DemConvention2020 #DemocraticConvention pic.twitter.com/s71Sy0cAYX— Loooorena &#34;La Tigresa&#34; Mesa @ #BlackLivesMatter 🖤 (@loooorenanicole) August 20, 2020 While we celebrate the rise of women in the USA government, we need to remember that as we celebrate the 100th year anniversary of women gaining the right to vote this right was not universally applied to all women. As Black (and indigenous women) continued to confront barriers to vote. Notably Black women were subject to racist state laws that aimed to keep Black Americans from voting. &#34;The 19th Amendment did not addres violence or lynching&#34;, Martha S. Jones author of &#34;Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All&#34; explains. Put another way, Democratic Vice President nominee Kamala Harris, explains this duality by stating simply, &#34;there is no vaccine for racism, we&#39;ve go to do the work. For George Floyd. for Breonna Taylor, for all the lives of too many others to name ... &#34;. &#34;There is no vaccine for racism. We&#39;ve got to do the work. For George Floyd, for Breonna Taylor, for the lives of too many others to name... None of us are free until all of us are free.&#34; - Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. #DemConvention https://t.co/LxbJJ2IiP2 pic.twitter.com/Sk6CtkSH2y— CNN (@CNN) August 20, 2020 The Democratic Convention continues tonight.

Just for fun The Daily Social Distancing Show host Trevor Noah beautifully captured Michelle Obama&#39;s Democratic Convention with the following: &#34;That was ice-cold. And what made it even more devastating was that Michelle Obama wasn’t angry, she wasn’t yelling, she just stated Trump’s complete failure as a president as an obvious fact. You know, it’s the difference between your mom screaming at you and your mom just casually sipping a coffee and going, ‘Well, not all kids can be winners.’&#34; 🔥 🔥 🔥 HRC and pantsuits.

Today begins with some continued speculation on what is happening with the questionable changes to USPS: &#34;What he did was take three big steps forward and took one baby step back, and that just doesn&#39;t do it for us,&#34; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commented on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy&#39;s annoucement to suspend changes to USPS until after the election. What are those changes? We are still waiting to hear. Will changes already implemented be rolled back (e.g. removal of sorting machines)? Again, that too is unknown. While changes to USPS may be in a suspended state, the USPS is still facing a suspected $25 billion USD dollar shortage.
