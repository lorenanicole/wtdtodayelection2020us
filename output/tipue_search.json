Last night a white teenager from Illinois took it upon themselves to drive to Kenosha, armed with an AR-15, to join those - that some outlets are calling it - that are &#34;prepared to defend buildings&#34;. Said teenager proceeded to use their gun during the protests. Three are confirmed to have been shot, two of those fatally. Files have been charged. The NIMBY rheotric so proudly flaunted earlier this week at that convention is eeirely timed with this. Let&#39;s not write this off as the lone act of a vigilante. We need to name what this act is, white supremacy. Chicago&#39;s WBEZ reported: According to witness accounts and video footage, police apparently let the young man responsible for the shootings walk past them with a rifle over his shoulder as members of the crowd were yelling for him to be arrested because he had shot people. White supremacy is domestic terrorism. A 17-year-old with a history of racist and misogynistic social media posts traveled to Kenosha and murdered two protesters. This is white supremacist terrorism.https://t.co/bHQzvFZ0LQ‚Äî African American Policy Forum (@AAPolicyForum) August 26, 2020 News Kenosha - Protests, Murder, &amp; Police Brutality WBEZ - Suspect Arrested After 2 People Were Shot And Killed During Kenosha Protest Kenosha - Protests, Murder, &amp; Police Brutality CNN - Two people are dead and a third injured in an overnight shooting in Kenosha, police say Kenosha - Protests, Murder, &amp; Police Brutality NBC Chicago - Teen Suspect in Kenosha Shooting Taken Into Custody in Illinois, Facing Charges: Police RNC Convention - Ethics: False Representation The Wall Street Journal - Immigrants in Trump-Led Ceremony Didn‚Äôt Know They Would Appear at RNC RNC Convention - Ethics: Hatch Act Business Insider - Trump aides &#39;take pride&#39; in violating ethics laws because it upsets the media at no cost to them, reports say RNC Convention - Ethics: Hatch Act POLITICO - Meadows dismisses Hatch Act concerns at RNC: &#39;Nobody outside of the Beltway really cares&#39; COVID19 - How COVID spreads NBC Chicago - How COVID-19 Most Commonly Spreads in Chicago: Arwady Events If this week isn&#39;t showing why we all need to show and engage in antiracism work, well Kim Crayton will show you.

Moving beyond idea that on moral grounds alone Biden is the right choice, though, Biden included some policy components of how to increase life for working class peoples. For example, Biden said he would revert the $1.3 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent to fund climate change policy, healthcare reform, and more. As a staunch progressive, I expect to see and need to hear more about how we will work to challenge institutional racism and other forms of opression. How we will protect the most vulnerable.

Last night, being the sci-fi nerd I am, in watching Lovecraft Country last night many pointed to how Lovecraft Country included several images such as the tribute to Gordon Park‚Äôs 1956 photograph outside a department store in Mobile, Alabama demonstrating the only to recent segregated past of the United States.
