Last night was the final night of the DNC Convention and there was no better way to start than with the adorable Cedric Jr, son of US Rep Cedir Richmond, posed in front of &#34;I am a man&#34; in a New Orleans art gallery, grinning ear to ear reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. CEDRIC YOU CUTIE PIE!

However, there was plenty of comedia relief offered by TikTok star and comedian Sarah Cooper as well as by last night&#39;s host acctress and comedian Julia Louis-Dreyfus who went on the record confirm she is &#34;proud to b a nasty, nasty woman&#34;. Trump is going to hate this. Thank you Sarah Cooper. #DemConvention pic.twitter.com/17qCbdRqSU— Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) August 21, 2020 Yes, I&#39;m here for all the nasty women. I, myself, am one. Thanks Julia. #DemConvention #DemConvention2020 #DNC2020 pic.twitter.com/BEATipf5eT— Loooorena &#34;La Tigresa&#34; Mesa @ #BlackLivesMatter 🖤 (@loooorenanicole) August 21, 2020 Biden&#39;s acceptance speech confirmed to many what they have been wondering, does Biden have enough energy to take on the Presidency? &#34;The best way through pain and loss and grief is to find purpose,&#34; Biden retorted on how loss in his life has been a catalyst for much of his career. Moving beyond the moral appeal, Biden included some policy components of how to increase life for working class peoples such as reverting the $1.3 trillion takecut for the wealthiest 1 percent to fund climate change policy, healthcare reform, and more. As a staunch progressive, I expect to see and need to hear more about how we will work to challenge institutional racism and other forms of opression. How we will protect the most vulnerable. How we will take climate change seriously. How we will ensure immigrants and refugees are welcome in the United States of America. Last night was a big step.

President Barack Obama, speaking at last night&#39;s Democratic Convention from Pennsylvania, delivered an emotionally charged and somber address. His message was simple, do not give up. Stay engaged. Plan: &#34;That is how *THEY* have influence over your life, when *THEY* convince [you that do not matter]; DO NOT LET THEM TAKE AWAY YOUR POWER, YOUR DEMOCRACY.&#34; - @BarackObama This. Is all you need to remember. Stay with me. Let&#39;s do it. #DemConvention #DemConvention2020— Loooorena &#34;La Tigresa&#34; Mesa @ #BlackLivesMatter 🖤 (@loooorenanicole) August 20, 2020 Furthermore, last night&#39;s Democratic Convention addresses focused on the role of women in politics. Notably Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pointing out, &#34;as America marks the centennial of women, finally, women winning the right to vote, we do so with 105 women in the House. Proudly, 90 are Democrats.&#34; KEEP RISING! (Notice @aoc is in the center. 👀😍). #DemConvention #DemConvention2020 #DemocraticConvention pic.twitter.com/s71Sy0cAYX— Loooorena &#34;La Tigresa&#34; Mesa @ #BlackLivesMatter 🖤 (@loooorenanicole) August 20, 2020 While we celebrate the rise of women in the USA government, we need to remember that as we celebrate the 100th year anniversary of women gaining the right to vote this right was not universally applied to all women. As Black (and indigenous women) continued to confront barriers to vote. Notably Black women were subject to racist state laws that aimed to keep Black Americans from voting. &#34;The 19th Amendment did not addres violence or lynching&#34;, Martha S. Jones author of &#34;Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All&#34; explains. Put another way, Democratic Vice President nominee Kamala Harris, explains this duality by stating simply, &#34;there is no vaccine for racism, we&#39;ve go to do the work. For George Floyd. for Breonna Taylor, for all the lives of too many others to name ... &#34;. &#34;There is no vaccine for racism. We&#39;ve got to do the work. For George Floyd, for Breonna Taylor, for the lives of too many others to name... None of us are free until all of us are free.&#34; - Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. #DemConvention https://t.co/LxbJJ2IiP2 pic.twitter.com/Sk6CtkSH2y— CNN (@CNN) August 20, 2020 The Democratic Convention continues tonight.

Just for fun The Daily Social Distancing Show host Trevor Noah beautifully captured Michelle Obama&#39;s Democratic Convention with the following: &#34;That was ice-cold. And what made it even more devastating was that Michelle Obama wasn’t angry, she wasn’t yelling, she just stated Trump’s complete failure as a president as an obvious fact.

Today begins with some continued speculation on what is happening with the questionable changes to USPS: &#34;What he did was take three big steps forward and took one baby step back, and that just doesn&#39;t do it for us,&#34; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commented on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy&#39;s annoucement to suspend changes to USPS until after the election. What are those changes? We are still waiting to hear. Will changes already implemented be rolled back (e.g. removal of sorting machines)? Again, that too is unknown. While changes to USPS may be in a suspended state, the USPS is still facing a suspected $25 billion USD dollar shortage.
