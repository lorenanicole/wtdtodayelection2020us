Another 43 million ballots have been or will soon be mailed to voters in the nine states -- along with Washington, DC -- that are automatically mailing ballots to eligible voters,&#34; CNN reports. Professor Michael McDonald of University of Florida reports that some 4,250,006 ballots have been cast as of October 6 2020 at 9:47am CT. Trump and his campaign continue to try to thwart public trust in early voting, largely as most of the surge in early voting is been powered by Democrats. Remember, on in mid July 2020 Trump laid his cards out when he informed Fox News Sunday host George Wallace in an interview that, &#34;I have to see&#34; when pressed for making a clear answer if he&#39;d accept election results: When asked if he can give a direct answer about whether he will accept the election, Trump replied, &#34;I have to see.&#34; pic.twitter.com/QgRWyCM3D4‚Äî Talking Points Memo (@TPM) July 19, 2020 Trump, his campaign, his adminstration, and those who will do whatever it takes to see their interests advanced are willing to continue to debase the very foundations of this country.

Polling from various groups shows that Biden&#39;s lead post the first Presidential Debate has increased including the Public Policy Polling group: We&#39;ve done about 70 private polls this week and a very noticeable trend we&#39;re seeing especially the last few days is that where before Biden was maybe getting 6-8% of 2016 Trump voters, that&#39;s pretty consistently starting to be more like 10-12%‚Äî PublicPolicyPolling (@ppppolls) October 4, 2020 However, reports from Trump over the weekend seem to indicate Trump is largely unbothered. Instead Trump &#34;told advisers on Sunday that he was getting bored being in the hospital and was tiring of watching coverage of his hospitalization,&#34; and instead opted for an impromptu joy ride to wave to supporters before returning back to Walter Reed hospital. Trump, while wearing a mask, was in an enclosed space with Secret Service and seemed to have no regard for the health of those protecting him. Sound on!!! This man yelling embodies all my fears and why this elections is so important. Please vote. https://t.co/kTbhKgJQOd‚Äî Jim Gaffigan (@JimGaffigan) October 4, 2020 The fallout continues as White House journalists are livid given the added news of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany has tested postitive for COVID19. Reporters have had strong feedback pointing out, &#34;Reporters have families and have been doing the right thing, wearing masks. The White House staff are relentlessly reckless.&#34; Additionally &#34;the White House residence staff members are largely Black and Latino, and often elderly&#34; have been needlessly exposed too. The continued bafoonery of the White House administration and Trump demonstrates plainly and. clearly: Trump and his people do not care about us. Nor will they do anything to contradict their own personal interest. The inaction to plan for COVID19, the failure to denounce White Supremacy, the fearmongering and attempt to thrawt public trust in mailin voting, the dismantling of indigenous people&#39;s sovereignty.

The news surrounding Trump&#39;s COVID condition has ranged from Republicans claiming Trump has &#34;no co-morbidities&#34; (even though, at age 74 Trump is very much at heightened risk) to Dr. Sean Conley informing the world that Trump is receiving dexamethasone, which is a &#34;steroid usually given to patients with sever COVID19&#34;. The confusing and contradictory information surrounding Trump&#39;s health status continues to demonstrate the overall lack of coherency that has come to mark this administration and campaign. As of the writing of this post, NYT lists 10 individuals who had contact with Trump before his positive status have contracted COVID10: Others like Mitch McConnell follow suite who, on Friday, refused to confirm if he&#39;s been tested. Ron Johnson too showed balatant disregard by attenting an Oktoberfest Party while awaiting his results. The future of the Trump campaign as well as the overall Republican strategy is bound to continue to amp up their campaign of misdirection.

Graduating top of her class from Columbia Law School from early in her career, Ginsburg faced barriers when trying to find employment and eventually obtaining employment at Rugers Law School, &#34;where her employers informed her that she would be paid less than her male colleagues because she had a husband who earned a good income&#34;. Ginsburg went on to lead the Women‚Äôs Rights Project at the ACLU. Her legal strategy focused on demonstrating the reality of sex discrimination by finding cases where men were those descriminated against. By building a basis that sex discrimination is real, she was able to help open the door for cases investigating sex descrimination towards women. As a Justice, Ginsburg was always vigiliant. When the Supreme Court became more conservative she stepped up to call out the inequities she observed. Famously stating of the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder ruling that dismantled core parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Ginsberg said, this ruling was &#34;like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet&#34;. Her dedication to public service, to intentional leadership that empowers women and is just led to her nickname &#34;The Notorious RBG&#34;.

Reading the update on what&#39;s next for The Dark Crystal, Lisa Henson observed, &#34;We have the Darkness creeping in, &amp; it feels like Darkness has arrived in the human world now. The carelessness for life, that sort of self-interest business of the Skeksis... the[y] are ruthless.&#34; This struck me hard -- the Dark Crystal is a reflection of the here &amp; now. Let me explain. Last night I observed the metaphorical Skeksis at The Republican National &#34;Convention&#34;. Yes, I know, &#34;why&#34; is likely a question you have. I wondered that too. (Also: if about 1/2 the lineup involves your family be them blood or by relationship is that really a strong sign of unity?) Night one was precisely as bizarre as expected. &#34;time to conquer earth!&#34; pic.twitter.com/VDQLKQscaW‚Äî ziwe (@ziwe) August 25, 2020 From people with no political know how to a &#34;not in my backyard couple&#34; made famous by touting guns and making veiled racist threats, night one demonstrated nothing. Nothing except the convention is a spectacle and the current admin will lie, cheat, and do anything to promote their interests. I walked away from night 1 of the DNC seeing Binden as a human. I&#39;m walking away from this wondering why Trump&#39;s kids can&#39;t even say he&#39;s a good person or they love him.‚Äî Jeff says, &#34;wear a mask&#34; üò∑ (@webology) August 25, 2020 Meanwhile in Kenosha, Wisconsin after the shooting of Jacob Blake, another unarmed Black man, protestors took to the streets.

Last night was the final night of the DNC Convention and there was no better way to start than with the adorable Cedric Jr, son of US Rep Cedric Richmond, posed in front of &#34;I am a man&#34; in a New Orleans art gallery, grinning ear to ear reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.

However, there was plenty of comedic relief. Such as the short skit by TikTok star and comedian Sarah Cooper impersonating Trump. Last night&#39;s host actress and comedian Julia Louis-Dreyfus also added her own punches and twists, even going on the record to confirm she is &#34;proud to be a nasty, nasty woman&#34;. Trump is going to hate this. Thank you Sarah Cooper. #DemConvention pic.twitter.com/17qCbdRqSU‚Äî Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) August 21, 2020 Yes, I&#39;m here for all the nasty women.

Moving beyond idea that on moral grounds alone Biden is the right choice, though, Biden included some policy components of how to increase life for working class peoples. For example, Biden said he would revert the $1.3 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent to fund climate change policy, healthcare reform, and more. As a staunch progressive, I expect to see and need to hear more about how we will work to challenge institutional racism and other forms of opression. How we will protect the most vulnerable. How we will take climate change seriously. How we will ensure immigrants and refugees are welcome in the United States of America. Last night was a big step.

President Barack Obama, speaking at last night&#39;s Democratic Convention from Pennsylvania, delivered an emotionally charged and somber address. His message was simple, do not give up. Stay engaged. Plan: &#34;That is how *THEY* have influence over your life, when *THEY* convince [you that do not matter]; DO NOT LET THEM TAKE AWAY YOUR POWER, YOUR DEMOCRACY.&#34; - @BarackObama This.

Notably Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pointing out, &#34;as America marks the centennial of women, finally, women winning the right to vote, we do so with 105 women in the House. Proudly, 90 are Democrats.&#34; KEEP RISING!

As Black (and indigenous women) continued to confront barriers to vote. Notably Black women were subject to racist state laws that aimed to keep Black Americans from voting. &#34;The 19th Amendment did not addres violence or lynching&#34;, Martha S. Jones author of &#34;Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All&#34; explains. Put another way, Democratic Vice President nominee Kamala Harris, explains this duality by stating simply, &#34;there is no vaccine for racism, we&#39;ve go to do the work. For George Floyd. for Breonna Taylor, for all the lives of too many others to name ... &#34;. &#34;There is no vaccine for racism. We&#39;ve got to do the work. For George Floyd, for Breonna Taylor, for the lives of too many others to name...

Today begins with some continued speculation on what is happening with the questionable changes to USPS: &#34;What he did was take three big steps forward and took one baby step back, and that just doesn&#39;t do it for us,&#34; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commented on Postmaster General Louis DeJoy&#39;s annoucement to suspend changes to USPS until after the election. What are those changes? We are still waiting to hear. Will changes already implemented be rolled back (e.g. removal of sorting machines)? Again, that too is unknown. While changes to USPS may be in a suspended state, the USPS is still facing a suspected $25 billion USD dollar shortage.

            "text":"The US Presidential Election is Tuesday, November 3 2020. To help keep you informed, this website will be updated daily to include information on election relevant -- meaning topical issues (e.g. prision abolition) as well as election specific -- news, events, and calls to action. Feedback is expected, wanted, and continuously appreciated. Why a digest? Why not? This project is greatly inspired by the awesome work of Matt Kisher&#39;s WTF Just Happened Today. Unlike Matt&#39;s work, this digest is diliberately progressive, left learning, and unapologetic in its position of it. Values of this project Accountability - we all have a hand in this Transparency - how this content is shared will be tied back to original sources Leave things better than how we arrived - yup, basically we all need to step up and do the work, no one gets a cookie because they tweeted a thing that one time Contribute Content What To Do Today US Election 2020 is all open source and managed on GitHub. If you&#39;d like to contribute content including news, events, or call to action open an issue using the issue template. You can also obtain this content via Tiny Letter. Thanks for all you do You are not alone. We matter. We can do this. But, we need to show up daily. Working together. This project is an ever evolving labor of love maintained by Lorena Mesa. A political scientist turned coder, Lorena can be found almost daily on Twitter.",
