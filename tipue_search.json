Details vary state to state and states are scrambling to clarify what date a mail in ballot can be accepted. Update: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) says he&#39;ll sign the bill to let all voters to vote by mail for November, meaning only 6 states home to 17% of Americans will require a mail voting excuse (all of which exempt voters age 65+). Texas is half of that 17% https://t.co/GyBZCcU9Wz https://t.co/VmqDNGVsKq‚Äî Stephen Wolf (@PoliticsWolf) August 18, 2020 So, how are you planning to vote?

Last night, being the sci-fi nerd I am, in watching Lovecraft Country last night many pointed to how Lovecraft Country included several images such as the tribute to Gordon Park‚Äôs 1956 photograph outside a department store in Mobile, Alabama demonstrating the only to recent segregated past of the United States. I want everyone to notice how @LovecraftHBO recreated powerful imagery from the segregated south. On the LEFT is Gordon Park‚Äôs 1956 photograph outside a department store in Mobile, Alabama.
